# Population Connectivity

Methodology based on Chan et al. 2011 and applied in Dalapicolla & Leite (2018):

CHAN, Lauren M.; BROWN, Jason L.; YODER, Anne D. Integrating statistical genetic and geospatial methods brings new power to phylogeography. Molecular phylogenetics and evolution, v. 59, n. 2, p. 523-537, 2011. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2011.01.020

DALAPICOLLA, Jeronymo; LEITE, Yuri Luiz Reis. Historical connections among river basins and climatic changes explain the biogeographic history of a water rat. PeerJ, v. 6, p. e5333, 2018. https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.5333


Here we implemented this methodolody in Python, using arcpy module. Do you need ArcGIS installed and also the toolboxes Analysis Tools, Spatial Analist Tools, Data
Management Tools. Scripts were built in collaboration with H. Seibel Jr.

Tutorial is in Portuguese, however I'm working on a English version and using QGIS and GRASS to avoid arcpy module.
